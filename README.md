# Welcome to Travel Location!

**Hi!** This is my very first application that I have tried out on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Will be updating more changes as it's only a basic application.


# How to run?
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Also, available [here](https://travel-location.herokuapp.com/).

(**PS:** It still has CORS error, so it needs to be disabled before using)


# What it does?
It randomly selects a location from a [JSON file](https://gist.github.com/Dhaneshmonds/1b0ca257b1c34e4842528dcb826ee880#file-indianstatesdistricts-json) and runs the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) and brings out results. Also, it is linked to their respective Wikipedia pages.
