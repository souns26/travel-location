# Welcome to Travel Location!

**Hi!** This is my very first application that I have tried out on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). This application works similar to the ‘_I’m feeling lucky_’ button on Google Earth - it brings you random locations around the world with which I have added some additional information in it like tourist attractions around the selected place and the corresponding Wikipedia pages of them.


# How to run?

 1. Install dependencies
 
 ```sh 
 npm install
 ```
 
 2. Start the development server
 
 ```sh
 npm run
 ```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Also, available [here](https://travel-location.herokuapp.com/).


# Tech Stack Used:
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html), [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)

APIs used: 
1. [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/)
2. [OpenTripMap API](https://opentripmap.io/docs)

**NOTE:** Feel free to suggest any changes in this application.
